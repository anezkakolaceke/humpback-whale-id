# Humpback Whale ID algorithm

The code in this repository was used in the "Humpback Whale Identification" competition on Kaggle. The original code can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/anezka/cnn-with-keras-for-humpback-whale-id

This code was originally written in a Jupyter notebook and ran in the Kaggle kernel.

Many versions of this CNN were attempted during the competition. Most of the code is still in the file commented. The uncommented lines are the ones corresponding to the version of the program that resulted in my best score in the competition.
